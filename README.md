# Huckleberry Agency Website

In this workshop, we'll build a minimal landing page for an agency.

This mockup is built entirely using _flow layout_: no Flexbox, no grid, no absolute positioning, no media queries. It relies heavily on padding, margin, and border, as well as some of the tricks we learned in Module 1.
